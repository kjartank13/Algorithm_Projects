In the popular show “Dinner for Five”, five contestants compete in preparing culinary delights. Every evening one of them makes dinner and each of other four then grades it on a scale from 1 to 5. The number of points a contestant gets is equal to the sum of grades they got. The winner of the show is of course the contestant that gets the most points.
